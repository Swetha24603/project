# E-commerce Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset using SQL to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. By querying the dataset, we generate actionable metrics, such as top-selling products and valuable customers, to aid in decision-making and business optimization.
## Objectives
- **Understand Customer Behavior** - Analyze customer purchasing patterns, segment customers based on their activities, and identify the most valuable customers.

- **Evaluate Product Performance** - Determine top-selling products, analyze product categories, and assess the contribution of each product to overall revenue.

- **Analyze Sales Trends** - Examine seasonal and monthly sales patterns to identify peak periods and improve forecasting accuracy.

- **Track Key Business Metrics** - Calculate key metrics like average order value (AOV), total revenue, and order frequency for informed decision-making.
## Tools and Technologies
